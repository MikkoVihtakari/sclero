sclero
======
**An R package to measure growth patterns and align sampling spots in photographs**

This is a developmental version of the *sclero* package providing functions to measure growth patterns and align sampling spots in chronologically deposited materials. The package is intended for the fields of sclerochronology, dentrochronology and geology. This R package is connected to the package author's PhD thesis and further presented in manuscripts under revision. The package is, therefore, subject to changes prior to a final stable version to be submitted to CRAN. Nevertheless, all the package *should* work as intended already.

Installation
-------
Using the *devtools* package:
```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("MikkoVihtakari/sclero")
```

User Manual
-------
A pdf version of the user manual is available under [`/inst/doc`][doc] and a source version under [`/vignettes`][vignettes] as an .Rnw file.

Contributions and contact information
-------
Any contributions to the package are more than welcome. Please contact the package creator Mikko Vihtakari (<mikko.vihtakari@gmail.com>) to discuss your ideas on improving the package.
